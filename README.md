## The Project Summary

After uploading the data, I performed the cleaning process and made the
data ready for further processing. Then I analysed this datasets". After these processes, I trained the data according to
the Naive Bayes and K-NN algorithms and tested the accuracy of the probability of
predicting the classes of the tweet . Then I compared these two algorithms. After
completing these training processes, I made sentiment analysis of the tweets.
Based on these, I created a diagram and word cloud. Finally, I made our data
guess whether its class was Trump or Biden according to the tweet input entered
according to the k-nn algorithm. These analyses and their visuals are available in file.
